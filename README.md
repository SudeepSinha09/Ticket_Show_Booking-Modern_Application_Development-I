# Ticket Show Booking (Modern Application Development - I)

The Ticket Show Booking project is a web application developed for IIT Madras - Modern Application Development - I course. The project allows users to book tickets online for various shows at different venues. The application is built using Flask, Jinja2 templates, and Bootstrap for HTML generation and styling. SQLite is used for data storage, and REST API is used for communication between the frontend and backend.

The project also includes features such as dynamic pricing, where show prices can go up or down based on popularity. All demos can be run on a standalone platform like replit.com, and no additional server setup is required for database and frontend management.

The terminology used in the project includes Ticket Booking Platform, Venue (list of shows, capacity, etc.), Show (name, rating, price, etc.), and Dynamic Pricing (optional).

The Ticket Show Booking project competes with similar products in the market such as BookMyShow and TicketNew, which are available on web, IOS, and Android platforms.
